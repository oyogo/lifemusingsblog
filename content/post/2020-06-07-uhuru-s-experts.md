**We all have a kingdom to rule and its prosperity is simply dependent on who sits on the right hand…..**

“I have set the LORD always before me; Because He is at my right hand I shall not be moved.” Psalms 16:8

The tenor of the president’s speech brought to prominence the mysterious power that sits behind the throne, he called them the ‘experts’.  We are keenly watching the transpiration of things given the advice of these experts and whatever the outcome, it goes without saying that the experts will be held accountable. These are they who influence the decisions of the monarch. In the annals of history we’ve had monarchs who have made shipwreck of their Kingdoms cause of the advises of the experts, similarly we’ve had those that prospered on account of the opinions of their advisors. It could be either of the two but the final decisions always rests on the one occupying the throne.

We all have this kingdom to rule, your life, and the prosperity of it is a question of who sits on the right hand of your throne. Your advisors/adviser/experts can be such as that will make shipwreck of your monarchy or such as than will steer it into victory or success. These experts can be your friends, your mum, your dad, the books you read, the programs that you watch and all that influences the decisions you make from time to time. It then begs the question, who are your expert(s)?,  what’s their disposition?, how qualified are they?, what’s their background?, what’s  your relationship to them?, how has your experience been having them on the right hand of your throne?.  As the president, we are not bound to take any of the advises for it fully rests with us as to which course to take upon getting their opinion, in other words we have our will power to engage, even God who created us, and as such, gave us the will, never coerces us to do anything for that would be tantamount to making us puppets. Choose ye this day has been His call from eternity past. 

Dear friend, I want to tell of an expert whose resume is way beyond the norm, His advice and opinion you can fully trust unequivocally. He has no records of failure in His work, those who trust Him attest to His wisdom unequalled, friends this expert is Jesus, you do well to have Him sit on the right hand of your throne and you’ll never regret it. Would you?
