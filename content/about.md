_Clinton Oyogo is my name...
Am a Data Scientist by profession...
A lover of nature, art, poetry, particularly music ; A teacher and a preacher..|

Above all am a student at the feet of Jesus and He's still working on me to make me what I ought to be.
Its my desire to help others grow in Faith and live a life full of purpose in Christ for I believe its God's desire 
that we prosper in all aspects of life.

I believe it's a social world and each of us can be a ladder for someone else to be a step ahead..

I look forward to inspire you and someone else with thoughts from God's word and personal experiences..._
