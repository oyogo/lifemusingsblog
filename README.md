# life musings blog  
I am an ambassador of upright living. This repository contains files for the blog through which I share thoughts that encourage right living and promote morals in the society.   
The blog is developed using [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) framework and deployed through [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
