        <p><em><strong>We all have a kingdom to rule and its prosperity is simply dependent on who sits on the right hand…..</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>“I have set the LORD always before me; Because He is at my right hand I shall not be moved.” Psalms 16:8</strong></p>

|The cause of history in the political arena has been shaped not only by the kings and monarchs who&rsquo;ve occupied thrones,
but also by those who wisper in their ears,
call them the grey eminence, the power behind the throne,  the <em>de facto</em>  rulers. These are they who pull strings, they wield potent power over rulers and their                                  influence can be for good or otherwise.|
Talk about Otto von Bismarck of Europe who was highly respected by Wilhem (I) the Kaiser of Germany, Richard Neville, the Earl of Warwick known as the &lsquo;Kingmaker&rsquo; owing to his power and wealth
to decide who sits on the throne. We have Diego Portales who ruled over Chile with an iron fist though he never occupied the highest position in the country and many others that time
and space wouldn&rsquo;t permit me to mention.</p>
<p>The president’s address on June 6, 2020 brought to prominence the power that sits behind the throne, he called them the ‘experts’.  We are keenly watching the transpiration of things given the counsel  of these experts and, whatever the outcome, it goes without saying that blame will be cast upon them should things go south, or perhaps, they will be extoled for their sagely counsel if otherwise. These fellows are they who influence the decisions of many a ruler. In the annals of history we’ve had monarchs/rulers who have made shipwreck of their Kingdoms owing to the insights of such fellows, on the flip side of it, we’ve also had those that thrived on account of their sapient enlightenment. The consequences are either for better or for worse. That notwithstanding, its always incumbent upon the ruler to make the final decision, to take their submissions, ignore them or even decide on which of the submissions to take in a situation where there are conflicting opinions.</p>
<p>We all have this kingdom to rule, your life, and the prosperity of it is to a great extent a question of who sits on the right hand of your throne. Your advisor(s)/experts can be such as that will make shipwreck of your monarchy or such as than will steer it into victory or success. These experts can be your friends, your mum, your dad, the books you read, the programs that you watch and all that influences the decisions you make from time to time. It then begs the question, who are your expert(s)?,  what’s their disposition?, how qualified are they?, what’s their background?, how do you relate to them?, how has your experience been having them on the right hand of your throne?.  As it were for the president, we are not bound to take any of the advises for it fully rests with us as to which course to take upon getting their opinion, in other words we have our will power to engage, even God who created us, and as such, gave us the will, never coerces us to do anything for that would be tantamount to making us puppets. Choose ye this day has been His call in all His entreaties.</p>
<p>Dear friend, there is this expert, the man Jesus Christ, who sits on the right hand of the Majesty of the monarch who rules the universe, what a power He wields. It’s said of Him that <em><strong>“..when He had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high”</strong></em> and that <em><strong>”We have such a high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens”</strong></em> .Why not have Him sit on the right hand of your throne? He has no records of failure whatsoever, He is trustworthy, loving and kind, for sure language is limited in giving a fitting description of His goodness, He has disappointed none, just try Him and you will never regret.</p>
<p>Thus David says, <em><strong>&ldquo;I have set the LORD always before me; Because He is at my right hand I shall not be moved&rdquo;</strong></em>. You do well to do likewise.</p>
<p>What an &lsquo;expert&rsquo; we have in Jesus!!</p>
